# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a TOEFL iBT preparation resource repository containing Japanese-language evaluation rubrics
and scoring guidelines for speaking and writing tasks. It is NOT a software application but a
documentation repository.

## Repository Structure

- `speaking/` - Contains 4 TOEFL speaking task rubrics (q1.md - q4.md)
- `writing/` - Contains 2 TOEFL writing task rubrics (q1.md - q2.md)

## Key Information

1. **Language**: All content is in Japanese
2. **Purpose**: Provides scoring criteria and feedback templates for TOEFL iBT tasks
3. **Target Users**: Japanese TOEFL instructors and self-study students

## Common Tasks

Since this is a documentation repository, common tasks include:

- Editing markdown files to update scoring criteria or feedback templates
- Organizing and structuring the evaluation rubrics
- Adding examples or clarifications to existing rubrics
- Formatting markdown files with Prettier: `pnpm format`
- Checking formatting: `pnpm format:check`

## Important Notes

- All markdown files use Japanese language for rubrics and instructions
- Each task file follows a structured format with scoring criteria, evaluation procedures, and
  feedback templates
- The repository uses pnpm for package management and Prettier for code formatting

## Development Guidelines

When working with this repository:

1. Maintain the Japanese language for all rubric content
2. Preserve the structured format of evaluation criteria (scoring scales, dimensions, procedures)
3. Ensure consistency across similar task types
4. Keep feedback templates practical and actionable
5. Avoid using HTML tags in markdown files - use plain markdown syntax instead

## Git Status

As of the initial commit, the `speaking/` and `writing/` directories are untracked and need to be
added to version control.
